# Google Home Local API

This is an unofficial documentation of the local API used by the Home app to communicate with the device.

### Getting Started

The port for the http server is `8008` so the base url for these endpoints is:  
`http://<google-home-ip>:8008`  
Get the IP of Google Home from the Google Home app (Device Settings -> End of list) or from your router.

There is no auth mechanism in place as of now.

GET requests are simple, in the browser kind.  
POST requests need to set the header: `content-type: application/json`
